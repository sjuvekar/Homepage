<h2>Reading </h2>
<p>
  I am an avid reader and love to read biographies, philosophy and science. Some of my favorite authors include Richard Feynman, Carl
  Sagan (two of my personal heroes as well!), Paulo Coelho and Malcolm Gladwell. I've listed some of my favorite book here. Most of them are in my collection. I'm trying to get my hands on good hardcover editions of others.
